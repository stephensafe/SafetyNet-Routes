    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      SafetyNet was built for people who need real privacy. No sign-ups. No data collection. Just clean, encrypted conversations that disappear forever when you close the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe everyone deserves a space to speak freely, without surveillance or trace. Your words are yours â€” and once a room burns, it's gone for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the future of safe communication. Welcome to SafetyNet.
